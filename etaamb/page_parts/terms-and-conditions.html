<h1>etaamb.be terms and conditions</h1>

<h3>What does this site do?</h3>
<p>Etaamb.be reproduces the contents of the Belgian Official Journal, in accordance with the <a href="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&la=F&cn=2002122431&table_name=loi" rel="nofollow">program law of December 24th 2002 (articles 472 to 478)</a>, while trying to apply user-experience enhancing techniques.</p>
<p>The contents of etaamb.be must not be interpreted and/or used as the official and/or authentic versions of contents originally published by the Official Belgian Journal, and etaamb.be cannot be held liable for missing, incomplete and/or incorrect information within the re-published documents, nor does etaamb.be offer any kind of warranty, support or help regarding these documents. </p>
<p>The services proposed by etaamb.be must be seen as experimental; they offer no guarantee of completeness, authenticity, or any other guarantee at all. Any usage made of the documents re-published by etaamb.be is at your own risk.</p>
<p>This site started as a temporarily technical experience, but remains active due to its high attendance, which has led the author to maintain its services to the internet community.</p>
<p>In any case, any text reproduced by etaamb.be has been initially published by the Belgian Official Journal, which is inherently public. Etaamb.be has no ownership of these contents, and cannot be held responsible or liable for reproductions in other publications or websites of the contents of the Belgian Official Journal.</p>

<h3>Anonymization, Private data</h3>
<p>Etaamb.be has been regularly in contact with the <a href="https://www.privacycommission.be/" rel="nofollow">Belgian Privacy Commission</a>, and does its best to abide by its rules and recommendations.</p>
<p>Particular document types which often include personal data are automatically anonymized by etaamb.be's algorithms, which strive to remove personal data while keeping the general contents readable. Documents which are not automatically anonymized can be anonymized on demand through the orange button at the top right corner of etaamb.be's pages.</p>
<p>Once a demand has been sent and received, it is reviewed and acted upon as soon as the time permits. Replies are only sent if more information is needed. Upon request, search results can be removed from the search engine indexes.</p>

<!--
<h3>Why are the policies written in english ?</h3>
<p>The author has chosen to write these pages solely in English to avoid misinterpretations and contradictions between versions. However, the author can be contacted in any of the Belgian official languages for more specific questions and answers.</p>
